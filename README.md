This is a little game I made, it just picks a Pokemon and scrambles its name and you have to guess it. Included are four gamemodes, including:
1. Guess a single scrambled name in as few guesses as possible
2. Guess as many Pokemon in a row as you can
3. Pick a certain number of Pokemon and take the shortest amount of time possible to guess all of them (speedrun mode)
4. Pick a timeframe and guess as many Pokemon correctly within that timeframe (1v1 multiplayer)

Enjoy!
